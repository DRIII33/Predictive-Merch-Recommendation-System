Final Report Summary

Disclaimer: This project scenario is based on publicly available information and general industry knowledge about YouTube Music and the music streaming market. It does not use any internal, proprietary, or confidential data from YouTube Music. The data sets, business problems, and solutions are all hypothetical and created for illustrative purposes.


Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to leverage BigQuery and Looker Studio to create a dynamic dashboard that provides actionable insights into YouTube Music merchandise sales. The dashboard addresses key business questions related to sales performance, marketing effectiveness, and fan engagement to help artists and their teams make data-driven decisions to increase revenue.

Key Insights & Recommendations
Tour Dates are a Primary Sales Driver: The Sales Volume Around Tour Dates chart revealed a significant spike in merchandise sales on and immediately surrounding tour dates.

Recommendation: Develop and execute targeted marketing campaigns in the weeks leading up to and following a tour. Consider offering tour-exclusive merchandise or special bundles to capitalize on increased fan engagement during these periods.

Video Presence Does Not Affect Average Price: The Average Sales Price by Merchandise Presence in Video chart showed no significant change in average sale price whether the merchandise was worn by the artist, a key player, or not present at all.

Recommendation: Reallocate resources from solely producing videos to justify higher prices. Instead, focus on strategies that directly impact sales volume and pricing, such as creating limited-edition drops or personalized merchandise offers based on fan demographics.

Fan Demographics & Location Are Key: The Sales by User Demographics and Total Sales by User Location charts provide a clear breakdown of where and to whom merchandise is being sold.

Recommendation: Use this demographic and geographical data to personalize marketing and promotions. Tailor messaging and merchandise offerings to specific fan segments to increase relevance and conversion rates.

Conclusion
The YouTube Music Merchandise Insights Dashboard is a powerful tool that transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. The insights confirm that tour dates are a critical event for merchandise sales and that average pricing is not influenced by video presence. By implementing the data-driven strategies identified in this report, the business can optimize its marketing efforts, increase sales, and drive significant revenue growth.
