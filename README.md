# Predictive Modeling for Personalized Artist Merchandise Recommendations Based on Music Video and Tour Analysis

## Project Goal
This project aims to develop a data science solution that predicts the likelihood of unique fan segments purchasing specific artist merchandise. The solution leverages an analysis of new music video releases, incorporating visual cues and performance metrics, as well as the temporal impact of artist tours. The ultimate goal is to generate new revenue streams for YouTube Music and provide a more powerful monetization tool for artists beyond traditional streaming.

## Key Success Metrics
* **Increased Conversion Rate:** The primary measure of success will be a quantifiable increase in the conversion rate of merchandise recommendations driven by the model.
* **Higher Fan Engagement:** Success will also be measured by increased user engagement with the merchandise shelf and related content.
* **Model Accuracy:** The predictive model's accuracy in identifying fans with a high propensity to purchase will be a key technical metric.

## Hypotheses
* **Video-Merch Correlation:** There is a strong correlation between the visual presence of merchandise in a new official music video (e.g., an artist or key player wearing it) and an immediate surge in merchandise sales.
* **Tour-Merch Correlation:** Fan purchase propensity for merchandise increases significantly in the periods before, during, and immediately after a tour.
* **Personalization drives sales:** A predictive model that combines video analysis, tour timing, and fan engagement data can provide more effective and personalized merchandise recommendations, leading to a higher purchase rate compared to generic recommendations.
